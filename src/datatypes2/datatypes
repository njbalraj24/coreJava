Data Types:
 In programming languages, data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable or constants.
 
Two types of data types in Java.
  1. Primitive Data Types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
  2. Non-Primitive Data Types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, String, and Arrays.
     - In Java, non-primitive data types are also known as reference data types.
     - It is used to store complex objects rather than simple values.
