Important Points to Remember
1. public

Accessible from anywhere (inside/outside the package).
Has the widest accessibility.
Used for methods and classes that need to be globally accessible.
2. private

Strictly the most restrictive modifier.
Limits access only to within the same class.
Essential for encapsulation and protecting sensitive data.
Not accessible outside the class, even in the same package.
Private constructor prevents object creation outside the class.
3. protected

Accessible within the same package.
Accessible outside the package, but only through inheritance.
More accessible than the default, but more restrictive than the public.
4. default

When no modifier is specified.
Limited access only to other classes within the same package.
Cannot be accessed outside the package, even by subclasses.
