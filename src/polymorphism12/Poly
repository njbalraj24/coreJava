Polymorphism:
 Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
 
Types of Polymorphism:
There are two types of polymorphism in Java
 Compile-time Polymorphism
 Runtime Polymorphism.
 
1) Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java:
In Java, method overloading is used to achieve compile-time polymorphism. 
A class can have numerous methods with the same name but distinct parameter lists thanks to method overloading. 
The compiler uses the amount and kind of parameters provided to it during compilation to decide which method to call. 
This choice is made during compilation, which is why it's called "compile-time polymorphism.

2) Runtime Polymorphism in Java
Runtime polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
