Inheritance:
 Is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
 It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
 
Why use inheritance?
 For Method Overriding.
 For Code Reusability.
 
Parent Class: Super Class, base class
Child Class: Sub Class, derived class, extended class.

extends: 
It keyword indicates that we are making a new class that derives from an existing class. 
The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

Types of Inheritance in Java
Single Inheritance: When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.

Multilevel Inheritance: When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. 

Hierarchical Inheritance: When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.

*** multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only ***

Advantages of Inheritance:
Code Reusability
Hierarchical Organization
Polymorphism
Easier Maintenance
