Stack:
 The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. 
 It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).
 
The stack data structure has the two most important operations that are push and pop. 
The push operation inserts an element into the stack and pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack
