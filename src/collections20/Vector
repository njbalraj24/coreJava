Vector:
 Vector is like the dynamic array which can grow or shrink its size. 
 Unlike array, we can store n-number of elements in it as there is no size limit.
 
It is similar to the ArrayList, but with two differences-
 Vector is synchronized.
 Java Vector contains many legacy methods that are not the part of a collections framework.
