Encapsulation:
 Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
 A capsule is the perfect example of encapsulation because a capsule is a mixture of several medicines.
 
Why Use Encapsulation in Java?
 Encapsulation helps to protect data and control access to it.
 It protects sensitive data from being access directly.
 It hides unnecessary data from the user of a class, and only shows the functionality of a class.
 Changes can be made internally without affecting the external interface.
