Map:
 The map interface in Java is a structure that holds a set of key-value pairs where each key is unique and points to one value only.
 It is a component of the java.util package and is being widely used in Java programming to structure and get data in an ordered manner. 
 A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
 
Why Java Map Interface?
 Efficient Data Retrieval
 No Duplicate Keys
 
HashMap:
 HashMap is an important data structure in Java which implements the Map interface. 
 In this way, it provides a scheme for storing of key-value pairs.
 
LinkedHashMap:
 LinkedHashMap is a class in Java that extends HashMap and implements the Map interface.
 LinkedHashMap has one of the special features of its keeping a doubly linked list of its entries, which enables you to go through the entries 
in either insertion or access order

TreeHashMap:
 TreeMap in Java is a sorted map implementation that stores key-value pairing in a Red-Black tree structure.
