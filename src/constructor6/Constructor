Constructor:
 A Constructor in Java is a block of codes like the method. 
 It is called when an instance of the class is created.
 It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
 
Two types:
 Default Constructor/no-arg constructor
 parameterized constructor
 
NOTE:
 It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation. 
 It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. Because Java compiler creates a default constructor if your class does not have any.
 
Rules for Creating Java Constructor:
 Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
 A Constructor must have no explicit return type.
 A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.
 
Rule: If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

Q) What is the purpose of a default constructor?
  The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
  
2) Java Parameterized Constructor
 A constructor that has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
 
Why use the parameterized constructor?
The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.
