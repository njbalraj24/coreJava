Deque:
 It is the subtype of the Queue interface. 
 Deque, short for double-ended queue. 
 The Deque supports the addition as well as the removal of elements from both ends of the data structure.
 
ArrayDeque Class:
 Unlike Queue, we can add or remove elements from both sides.
 Null elements are not allowed in the ArrayDeque.
 ArrayDeque is not thread safe, in the absence of external synchronization.
 ArrayDeque has no capacity restrictions.
 ArrayDeque is faster than LinkedList and Stack.
