Collections:
 The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
 Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
 Java Collection means a single unit of objects.
 
Java Collection framework provides,
 - interfaces (List, Queue, Set, Deque)
 - classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
 
What is Collection framework:
 The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects.
 It enhances code efficiency and readability by offering various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables, 
tailored to different programming needs. It has:
 1. Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
 2. Algorithm
 
Advantages of the Java Collection Framework:
 Reusability, Quality, Speed, Maintenance.
 
Hierarchy of Collection Framework: REFER THE SCREENSHOT in Diffs

Iterable Interface
 The Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes. 
 The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface and therefore all the subclasses of Collection interface also implement the 
   Iterable interface.
 It contains only one abstract method.
 
Collection Interface
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework. 
It declares the methods that every collection will have. 
In other words, we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

List Interface
List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. 
It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. 
It can have duplicate values.
List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList(); 

Queue Interface
Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order. 
It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed. 
There are various classes like PriorityQueue, Deque, and ArrayDeque which implements the Queue interface.

Queue<String> q1 = new PriorityQueue();

Set Interface
Set Interface in Java is present in java.util package. 
It extends the Collection interface. 
It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items. 
We can store at most one null value in Set. 
Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

Set<data-type> s1 = new HashSet<data-type>();


Difference Between List and Set
A list can contain duplicate elements whereas Set contains unique elements only.
