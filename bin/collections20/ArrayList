ArrayList:
 ArrayLists come from the java.util package and are quite commonly used for their ease of use and flexibility.
 The ArrayList in Java can also have duplicate elements.
 
Get and Set ArrayList:
You can retrieve and modify an ArrayList using the get() and set() methods.

Using get() method:
 The get( ) method is used to retrieve the element at a certain index in the ArrayList.
 It takes an integer argument which specifies the element index to be brought back.
 The indexing begins with 0, which represents the initial element, and ends with size() - 1 for the last element in the ArrayList.

Using set() method:
 The set() method is used to replace the element at a specific index in the ArrayList with a new element.
 It takes two parameters: the index of the element to replace and the new element to be placed at that index.
 The previous element at the specified index will be overwritten by the new element.
