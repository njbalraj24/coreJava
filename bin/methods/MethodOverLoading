Method overloading 
in Java is the feature that enables defining several methods in a class having the same name but with different parameters lists.

There are two ways to overload the method in java:
1. By changing number of arguments
2. By changing the data type

*** In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only. ***

Q) Why Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only?
If two methods have the same name and parameter list but different return types, the compiler cannot determine which method to call 
based solely on the return type.
*** ambiguity occurs ***
