Method:
In general, a method is a way to perform some task.
Method in Java is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task. It provides the reusability of code.
A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation.

Why Methods (Key Characteristics)?
 Reusability: Methods provides code reusability
 Modularity: Methods help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
 Maintainability: With methods, updating and debugging code becomes easier since changes in one part of the program do not necessarily 
  impact other parts.
 Abstraction: Methods provide a way to encapsulate implementation details, exposing only the necessary parts to the users.
 
Method Declaration:
 The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return-type, name, and arguments.
 It has six components that are known as method header.
 Access Specifier: Public, Private, Protected, Default
 Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns.
 Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method.
 Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses.
 Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed.
 
Types of Method:
Predefined Method: 
 method that is already defined in the Java class libraries.
 Some pre-defined methods are length(), equals(), compareTo() etc.
 
User-defined Method
 The method written by the user or programmer is known as a user-defined method.
 
Static Method:
 A method that has static keyword is known as static method.
