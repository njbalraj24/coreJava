Array:
 Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. 
 The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. 
 It is a data structure where we store similar elements. 
 We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
 
Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.

Advantages
 Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
 Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.

Disadvantages
 Size Limit: Arrays have a fixed size and do not grow dynamically at runtime.
 
Types of Array in java
There are two types of array.

 Single Dimensional Array: A single-dimensional array in Java is a linear collection of elements of the same data type.
 Multidimensional Array: A multidimensional array in Java is an array of arrays where each element can be an array itself. 
                         It is useful for storing data in row and column format.
                         
Length of Array:
 int[] num = new int[10];     
 //length is an Array attribute that determines the array length     
 int arrayLength=num.length;
